a console-based tic-tac-toe game written in python.  
my cse101 project, later upgraded with a rule-based ai opponent, later upgraded with minimax ai.

`dummy_tic_tac_toe.py` is the original version, computer plays randomly.

the ai in `ai_tic_tac_toe.py` is a simple rule-based system.  
it sometimes makes random mistakes. the goal was to make it feel more human and unpredictable.

the ai in `minimax_tic_tac_toe.py` is an unbeatable minimax algorithm.

## how to play
you are X, the computer is O.  
use row number and column letter for inputs like 1a, 2b, 3c to make your move.  
to exit at any time, enter 00.
